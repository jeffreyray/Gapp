displayed

ancestry with the Form trait applied

the label of the page in the notebook when changed

- added "find" method to Gapp::Container
- add "toplvel" method to Gapp::Widget
- BUGFIX: when subclassing a container widget, and overriding the 'default'
property of the the content, parent values were not being set on the children
- BUGFIX: when creating a Gapp::Widget without keeping a reference to it, the
Gapp::Object would be garbage collected before the Gtk2::Widget was destroyed. Fixed
by creating a circular reference between the Gapp object and the Gtk widget. When
the Gtk object emits the "destroy" signal, the circular reference is broken, and
all involved objects are garbage collected.
